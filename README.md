# [hattira][1] - events around you

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caulagi/sntd.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caulagi/sntd)

hattira - Events around you - is a webapp to allow people
to easily discover what is happening in a city.  The key
words are easy and discover.  The existing solutions
feel like a 800 pound gorilla.  I wanted instead
a simple solution that does two things -

 * Find in a glance what is happening in a city.
 * Create an event as an organizer in less than a minute.
 
Did I succeed?  Let me know!
